# Java Multi-Client Chat Application

This project is a simple yet powerful multi-client chat system built using Java sockets. It demonstrates how to create a real-time messaging application where multiple clients can connect to a central server, send messages, and receive broadcasts from other connected users.

---

## 🧠 Overview

- **Language:** Java  
- **Architecture:** TCP-based client-server model  
- **Functionality:**  
  - Multiple clients can connect concurrently  
  - Each client sends a username on connection  
  - Messages are broadcasted to all connected clients with sender identification

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Java JDK 8 or higher
- All devices (clients & server) must be on the same network or accessible via IP

---

### 🔧 Compilation

Open terminal in your project folder and run:

```bash
javac Server.java
javac Main.java
````

---

### 🖥️ Run the Server

```bash
java Server
```

You should see:

```
Server started on: 192.168.xx.xx:9080
```

This means the server is running and ready to accept client connections.

---

### 💬 Run the Client

On the same machine or any other device on the network:

```bash
java Main
```

* Enter a username when prompted
* Type messages and press Enter to send

> ⚠️ **Important:**
> Update the server IP in `Main.java` before compiling:

```java
Socket socket = new Socket("192.168.xx.xx", 9080);
```

Replace `192.168.xx.xx` with your actual server IP.

## 📷 Example Output

**Client A Terminal:**

```
Enter your username: Alice
💬 Bob: Hello everyone!
💬 Alice: Hi Bob!
```

**Client B Terminal:**

```
Enter your username: Bob
🟢 Alice has joined the chat
💬 Bob: Hello everyone!
💬 Alice: Hi Bob!
```
